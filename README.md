## Getting started

1. Download the corresponding binary for your operating system and architecture from the [releases](https://github.com/JulesMike/spoty/releases) page.

2. Create a Spotify application [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

    > Take note of the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for use in the next step.

3. Setup the proper environment variables (Check the [configuration](#configuration) section for references)
    
    Example from [.env.dist](.env.dist):
    ```sh
    PROD=false
    CLIENT_ID=111fedce236f4d34a607711a7ac4a606
    CLIENT_SECRET=fb4d98819b912dfd90d5803bb668ad24
    HOST=localhost
    PORT=13337
    CACHE_MAX_KEYS=64
    CACHE_MAX_COST=1000000
    ```

4. Edit the `Redirect URIs` setting of your application in spotify to match the environment variables:

    Example:
    ```sh
    http://<HOST>:<PORT>/api/callback
    ```

5. Execute the binary and head to the `/api` route and expect this json response with a HTTP status code `200`:

    ```json
    {
        "success": "i'm alright!"
    }
    ```

## Usage

To access most of routes, you'll need to authenticate yourself against spotify by going to the `/api/authenticate` route:

Example:
```sh
http://<HOST>:<PORT>/api/authenticate
```

1. You should be redirected to spotify for authentication. 
2. After which you will be redirected back to the url specified in `REDIRECT_URL`.
